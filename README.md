## Description

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to schedule their work day from 9 AM to 5 PM. The application dynamically generates time blocks for each hour of the workday, and users can enter their tasks or events in each time block. The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether the time has already passed (gray), the current time (red), or future time (green). Users can save their events, and the data is stored in local storage, allowing the saved events to persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- Displays the current date at the top of the calendar.
- Generates time blocks from 9 AM to 5 PM, dynamically updating the current hour's color.
- Allows users to enter and save events for each hour.

- Saves events in local storage for data persistence.
